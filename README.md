# ðŸ›’ Retail Sales Analytics Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project simulates a **retail sales analytics pipeline** by integrating:

* **API data (Fake Store API)** for product details
* **Python automation** for generating synthetic sales transactions
* **PostgreSQL database** for structured storage and querying
* **Google Sheets** for visualization and reporting

The dataset captures **transaction-level retail sales**, including customer demographics, product categories, pricing, and profitability metrics.

The goal is to demonstrate how businesses can:

* Collect and store sales data efficiently
* Automate ingestion from APIs
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in sales, customers, and profitability
* Build an **end-to-end pipeline** from raw data to actionable insights

This project showcases practical skills in **data engineering + analysis**, replicating real-world workflows that analysts and consultants use for decision-making.
